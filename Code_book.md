### LOAD LIBRAIRES
#### For this scrip we're using to the library "dplyr", this library is famous for the easy drive for the data bases.

### DOWNLOAD AND READ FILES
#### 1. The download for the activity is a "zip" file, that once downloaded the file, we use the unzip funtion for decompress.
## NOTE: I recommend configured the dirctory for the workig with the setwd() funtions
### 2. Loading the "txt" files for the Test, Train, and the features and labels activity
